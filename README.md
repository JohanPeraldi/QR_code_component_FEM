- Love for coding ❤️

### What I learned

Not much to be honest. It's always good to go back to the fundamentals though and practice positioning elements with CSS. Also, making sure that there are no unnecessary scrollbars and that elements do not overlap when playing around with the viewport size can be a bit tricky.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Always comes in handy when working with flexbox.

## Acknowledgments

I want to thank my code editor, VS Code, without which I would probably not be here today, as well as GitHub Copilot for helping me out with this challenge as it has with so many other projects. You guys are awesome! I also want to thank the Frontend Mentor community for providing me with the opportunity to practice my skills and learn new things.
